## Airbnb PH Price Prediction
#### An updated personal version of the Capstone project based on the https://github.com/ZL63388/capstone-project-airbnb repository

## Reason for update
#### After the bootcamp, I continued my learning through Data Science Infinity program by Andrew Jones and understood more of the concept behind Regression models. I decided to use our Capstone project dataset to see if it improved the model and to apply what I have learned from the DSI program.

## Insights
#### 1. Random Forest Regression from this updated model got better results and is not overfitting vs the Random Forest Regression used on our project
#### 2. XGBoost dataset used from the Capstone project dropped several columns vs the updated Random Forest Regression model in this repository

   #### XG Boost dropped columns - url,rating,type_airbnb, province, is_shared_room, is_private_room, num_nearby_tourist_spots_3km, num_nearby_supermarkets_3km, num_nearby_restaurants_3km,entire_home, latitude, longitude, population,area,covid_total,covid_active, type_airbnb_label, province_label, foreign_travelers
   #### Random Forest dropped columns - url, population, area, foreign_travelers, covid_total, covid_active, longitude, latitude
